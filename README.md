   In the new study, researchers from the University of Oxford, the National Research Council of Canada and 
   the National University of Singapore (NUS) showed that entanglement can also be achieved in macroscopic objects 
   at room temperature. "What we have done is demonstrate that it's possible with more standard, everyday objects—
   if diamond can be considered an everyday object," says study co-author Ian Walmsley, an experimental physicist at Oxford. 
   "It's possible to put them into these quantum states that you often associate with these engineered objects, 
   if you like—these closely managed objects."

5. New quantum record as ball of atoms ends up in two spots at once

   By the time the BEC reaches the top of the chamber, its wave function is a 50-50 mixture of those states, representing    positions 54 centimetres apart. It stays in this superposition for about a second, then falls back down. At the bottom, the lasers turn the two states back into one, and this reveals that the atoms appear to arrive from two different heights, confirming that the BEC was indeed in a superposition at the top of the chamber.
